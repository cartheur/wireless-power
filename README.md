A collection of my works on wireless power | 2004 - 2023

## The backstory

I first became fascinated with the concept of wireless power after reading about Nikola Tesla as a teenager. After the fandom faded, I set out to make practical models of the transmission of energy without wires connecting between. 

### March 2004 - Getting serious

Coming soon.

### Year 2011 - Making progress

Here is m.e with the Model 'G' lamp.

### Year 2016 - A dramatic pause

Summer 2015 I completed the Model 'G9' (Valerie) and arrived at a theoretical concept called "inductive linking". This was the last, besides the last stop of the power array in the winter of 2011.

### Year 2023 - A (re)new(ed) beginning

Now we are starting to take this all very seriously.
